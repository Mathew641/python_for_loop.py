# Here first we try to print some iterative variable using loop.

'''for num in range(1,11):
    print(num)
'''
# Here inside parantheses three argument are present- first one-1(included), second one-11(excluded), third one- step1(by default)

'''for num in range(1,11,2):
   print(num)'''
# this is how we can print numbers 1 to 10 by giving 2 step jump from each number or we can also consider it as a odd number program . 

# Now let's write program to print number in reversal order.
'''for num in range(10,0,-1):
    print(num)'''
# as step value is always remains 1 by default, so we need to change step value argument according to our program requirement.

# this is how we iterate the value using for loop but important thing is here we knew the no. of iteration.

# in -- in is a keyword for the "for loop"

# range ---  range is a inbuilt function in python which generating value in our program.
# range(1,11)-- create the List containing numbers 1 to 10. List is a data type in python.


# List data type in python is somewhat like array data type in C,C++ but the only difference is that list can comprise of heterogeneous elements unlike array.abs(x) 
# i.e. in one list can have integer vaue, float value, char value, double value, string etc...



# How d owe declare list in python, let's see..
'''list = [1,4,4,6,8,3,5]
print(list)
'''

#Ques.. WAP to calculate sum of given list elements using for loop?
'''int_list1 = [1,5,8,10,-6,8,45]
list1_sum=0
for num in int_list1:
    list1_sum = list1_sum + num

print("Sum of all the elements in list1 is",list1_sum)'''
